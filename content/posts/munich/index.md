## Munich, Germany

### Day 1

We got off our night flight from Canada and walked through the Munich airport in a complete daze. We only had two hours until our train to Prague left so we decided to check out the city. We walked throughout the center, found some coffee, got a pastry, and followed a kid through a door looking for directions and found a beautiful cathedral. Then we headed for the train to Prague!
