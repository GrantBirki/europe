## Budapest, Hungary

Budapest had a feeling of disarray, wildness, and a whole stink'n lot of cigarette smoke. After last minute booking a new AirBnb we got off at the last stop - or the central station of Budapest. Before taking the metro to the place, we stopped by a bathroom. It was to no surprise they made you pay to "maintain" the bathroom you used which was far from maintained. I walked in being forced to pay for toilet paper while Grant continued onward to pee. The man who collects money hollered a very ugly Hungarian "Hallo! Hallo!" (at Grant) and we kept walking. On the way out (of the bathroom) the man followed Grant and said "money, you pay". Grant didn't have any money so he played it off and said to the man "oh money? ATM that way!", and Grant pointed in the other direction. After sufficiently confusing the man enough, Grant managed to pee without paying. On the way to the AirBnb, we had to wait and sit on the ground for about an hour (and had a snack, photo below). Our over priced, totally crappy AirBnb was perfectly located. Soon after, we went to explore Pest.

While out for the evening we stumbled across the "Ruin Bars", the largest Jewish Synagogue in Europe, and many many streets of restaurants. The Ruin Bars are a place after communism fell, a bar decided to move into an abandoned building and make them their own with all kinds of junk. They were incredibly cool. Downtown Pest was all about nightlife and we stumbled upon old couples dancing in the park late one night. With the long amount of time we had in Budapest, the slightly more bearable heat, we were having a wonderful time. "Buda" has a completely different feel - which is just right across the river with the castle, run down neighborhoods, and the Fisherman's Bastion. We visited Buda three times. Once we went to the Thermal Bath. Since we were on a budget, we chose the cheapest bath and it was a really cool experience. There were five pools, two saunas, and a steam room. It made our tired bodies feel new and refreshed. Also, while in Buda we went adventure cave spelunking.

This was by far the most fun part of our stay. We squeezed ourselves into cracks underneath the mountains of Budapest, got very dirty, and found many bruises the next day. We even found ourselves in the "death sandwich" where Grant had to breathe out to move. It was AWESOME!! And our last time in Buda you would find our crazy selves hiking Gellert Hill with our packs on, sweating, and with no water. Brilliant! Budapest served us well with lots of wonderful places, sights, and pistachio ice cream. As we were waiting in the Starbucks for our train to come at 6:30 we were thinking this has been great but we don't have a story we will always remember quite like Poland and so we unwillingly decided to make a mistake which tested us both greatly.
