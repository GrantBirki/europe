## Vienna, Austria

### Day 1

Leah and I decided that Vienna was more of a "practical" city. By this we mean that it is a place you would want to live in. It has plenty of places to work, lots of housing, and a lot to do for locals. In our opinion it didn't have a lot to do for travelers on a budget. It was quite expensive and much of the city was newer. We did have a lot of fun just being goofs around the city with Leonie and seeing the Austrian lifestyle. We got to Vienna during the start of the heat wave and the first few days didn't go to well for us. All three of us crash landed in a park for about 3 hours where it was 90 degrees (F) in the shade. Once we could manage the heat, sightseeing at the palace was beautiful and our highlight of Vienna.

P.S. Agnes was a wonderful host (Leonie's cousin)
